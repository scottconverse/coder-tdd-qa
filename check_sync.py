"""Drift guard between SKILL.md (canonical) and SKILL-LITE.md (derived).

Four assertions:
  1. MATCH    - every sync block present in both files is identical.
  2. PRESENCE - every block marked lite:required in SKILL.md exists in
                SKILL-LITE.md, and every block in SKILL-LITE.md still exists
                in SKILL.md (no orphans).
  3. COVERAGE - every numbered rule in SKILL.md's HARD RULES section carries a
                sync annotation (lite:required or lite:excluded). Adding a rule
                without deciding its lite fate is a failure, not an oversight.
  4. PINS     - SKILL-LITE.md contains the safety-critical phrases that have no
                synced counterpart (the escalation tripwire). They may be
                reworded but never deleted.

Usage: python check_sync.py [path/to/SKILL.md] [path/to/SKILL-LITE.md]
Exit 0 = in sync. Exit 1 = drift; each problem printed on stderr.
Stdlib only.
